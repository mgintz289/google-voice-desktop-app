# google-voice-desktop-app-arm

This fork of the [google-voice-desktop-app](https://github.com/jerrod-lankford/google-voice-desktop-app) fixes the original's Mac quirk of doubling badge count, and fixes the icon size to be within the Mac style. It has not been tested with other OSs. It works as of November 13 2024, but will likely become less functional over time. Those interested in this repository are encouraged to ensure that these changes do not affect other OSs, and any who do so are encouraged to let me know. Pull requests will be reviewed.
